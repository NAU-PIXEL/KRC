Tim / Robin:

Here is the KRC distribution, attached as a tar file. It has not had
much use yet, so I would save your current working version in a safe
place. It contains all the source code, an updated helplist.txt and a
major rewrite of the LaTeX documentation.

Note the new type 54 output file, and the MODIFIED type 52. Both of
these adjust some dimensions to the actual number of latitudes and/or
seasons and cases used; making for more efficient files; see the revised
explanation in helplist.txt

Note the [partial] list of IDL routines at the end of helplist.txt.

The only significant computation modification is to now use a scale
height base on the current atmospheric temperature. This should not
change surface temperatures noticeably.

It would be good to update several input parameters:
AtmCP to 860. Based on MARS p.855 (default 800 probably too low)
CABR  ? Based upon TES spectra of the clearest atmosphere?
DUSTA and TAURAT and ARC2  based on Clancy analysis ?

This is a 'beta' (maybe alpha) distribution, so please let me know of
errors, obfuscations, shortcomings, ...  To my amasement, there are only
5000 lines of code here


In a directory one level above the place you wish to have KRC reside,
untar the krc.tar file.
Then read AAREADME for further instructions.  Enjoy

Hugh
