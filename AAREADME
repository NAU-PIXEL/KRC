2004jul21 Distribution set for KRC Thermal Model


	SEQUENCE TO GENERATE THE DISTRIBUTION SET.

Create an empty dist/ directory

Create soft links to all code needed

Create soft links to a few sample input files

Create the Makefile. This is based on Hugh Kieffer's system rules, 
modified by he and Kris Becker for running KRC on a customer Linux system.

Create a subdirectory  'output'

Make the main program:  make krc
  Rename the binary to krc_made

	TESTING DONE 2004Jul21 (not required to make distribution set)

Run krc on each of the sample input files
krcin_master.inp
testfileoutput.inp
krcone_master.inp

Build the LaTeX document all the way to Postscript.

Final:  Delete the contents of the   output  directory
	Delete the intermediate LaTeX files
	Delete all the *.o files

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	STEPS TO BUILD THE  KRC  SYSTEM AND USE IT

In a directory one level above the place you wish to have KRC reside,
untar the krc.tar file.

Make the main program:  make krc
 If this fails, get help from your local guru.
 The binary  krc_made  was made from the distribution files;
it may work for you.

Print the help file: helplist.txt   >>>>   READ IT   <<<<
Print the documentation. krc.ps
  note, the LaTeX source files, *.tex are also present.

Run krc on each of the sample input files. To do this, > krc
 When prompted for input file, enter the sample file name, without any 
    encasing quotes and no leading or trailing blanks.
 When prompted for print file, you may simply enter a bare slash  "/"
    to keep the name  krc.prt
Look at the print file to see what was done.
Look at the  output  directory to see if the expected binary files were created.

krcin_master.inp should produce
-rw-r--r--    1 hkieffer   149568 Jul 21 10:16 A25I0200T20C18Pzone.tdi

testfileoutput.inp should produce (with your ownership and date) 
-rwxr--r--    1 hkieffer    77312 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.t52*
-rwxr--r--    1 hkieffer   240640 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.t51*
-rwxr--r--    1 hkieffer   214016 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.t54*
-rwxr--r--    1 hkieffer   437248 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.t53*
-rw-r--r--    1 hkieffer   479360 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.td0
-rw-r--r--    1 hkieffer   149568 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.tdm1
-rw-r--r--    1 hkieffer  1634880 Jul 21 10:21 krcsamp.td1

krcone_master.inp  should not produce a binary output file.
The warnings "TDISK:2, WRITE, BUT NO FILE OPEN" are normal;
 you may ignore them.

Then, copy either master input file, make the changes you wish, 
and run     krc  .
Note that  one.inp  contains the points to be output; the 
model is defined by the values in   krcone_master.inp

There are two IDL routines which help to calculate
when to start a model if you want to begin storing seasonal records
after running for a while to approach equilibrium.
