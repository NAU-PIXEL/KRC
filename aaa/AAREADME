        GUIDE TO BUILDING THE KRC DISTRIBUTION TAR FILE

------------ Begin  ONLY FOR THE FIRST DISTRIBUTION  Begin------------

Decide on the top directory of the distribution files.   ~/krc/Dist/
Decide on the directory structure below this. My normal architecture is 
-/aaa   Scripts to make distribution, installation guides, Makefile
-/doc   Docucmentation on the system
-/src   Source code other than IDL, copy of makefile[s]
-/idl1   Source IDL code, essential for reading type 5x output files
-/idl2   Source IDL code, other
-/run   Input files
-/run/output  To hold output of runs
-/addon Updates after a full distribution

Create the distribution system scripts
Put all these in krc/aaa/  Edit in semi-permanent fashion
Any other files that must be edited: copy them into krc/aaa and edit there

Script files: 
step1  Creates the directory structure

step2  Updates any documentation files, such as running latex and ps2pdf

step3  Script file to build accumulate all the source code and files needed to
 make and run the executable application.

 - Makefile  The make file to build the shared object library system. 
   May need to edit for your local system environment

step4  Script to make the tar file

step6  Copy edited versions of files unique to specific installation on top 
        of the distribution version.

---------------  End  ONLY FOR THE FIRST DISTRIBUTION  End ----------------

For a new release:
If any new routines or new input files:
  Add these to the soft links in step3
  Update the Make file


Execute the /home/hkieffer/krc/Dist/step3 script[3], which empties the build
area, creates directories and copies files into the build area

  RENAME the prior distribution tar file to archive it

Execute the /home/hkieffer/krc/Dist/step4 script, which will move to one
directory above the construction directory and Tar the entire code set,
following the symbolic links

Send  AAinstall krcdist.tar  to the customer

	TESTING 

Test the build:
 cd ~/krc/impl
untar the Dist file
Follow the directions of AAinstall

Once all works well, copy or link-to the executable krc into  -/run 

Final:  Delete the intermediate LaTeX files
	Delete all the *.o files


       TRANSFER

callasu   to login to ASU
~/bin/gp G /work2/krcdist.tar   to pull from hulk to ASU

if does not work, may need to edit gp on hulk, then 

gp p bin/gp asu  to push new version of gp to ASU

bastion will not repond to pings.

scp /work2/krcdist.tar
