       GUIDE TO INSTALLING THE KRC DISTRIBUTION

In a directory one level above the place you wish to have KRC reside,
untar the krcdist.tar file.

  ./aaa/AAREADME will describe how the distribution package was made.

Files in ~/doc/ that may be helpful

  krc.ps and krc.pdf 
     PostScript and dpf  are the same description of some of the algorithms

  helplist.txt
        General help in setting up input files. ASCII text 
	Most of this is MANDATORY READING

In ./run/ there is a Makefile. This invokes  sysdef.rules  which may need 
ediiting for your site. See your local Guru.

./run/krc_made is the pre-made executable for PC linux

./run/krcone_master.inp
        Sample input file for running KRC in one-point mode.

./run/krcin.inp
        Sample input file for running full-up KRC

./idl/when2start.pro
        IDL routine to compute KRC start date

./idl/l_s.pro
        IDL routine for general conversion between Ls and dates
        [ Called by when2start ]


--------------- To make the executable --------------- 
cd Dist    # cd into the top of the Distribution system 
cd src
# may take some Guru to edit your local setup: sysdef.rules  & Makefile

make krc        
 # when successful
cd ../run
ln -s ../src/krc    # Then can run krc in the run directory
			# You may keep your input files here
			# Suggest that you send output files to ../out
			#   or somewhere outside the KRC Distribution system
# After deciding which test or your own input file to use:
krc          # this will start the execution. ALrady
