       Guide to installing the KRC distribution


In a directory one level above the place you wish to have KRC reside,
untar the krcdist.tar file.

  ./aaa/AAREADME will describe how the distribution package was made.

Files in ~/doc/ that may be helpful

  helplist.txt
        General help in setting up input files. ASCII text 
	Most of this is MANDATORY READING

In ./src/ there is a Makefile. This invokes  sysdef.rules  which may need 
editing for your site. See your local Guru. Then do:  make krc
which should complile, although there will be about screenfull of warnings.

It will keep your file separated if in the run directory you make a line to the
executable: 
   ln -s ../src/krc .

run krc.  It will ask for an input file, and you can respond:   testr.inp <CR>
  At the request  for a print file name, you can respond simply:  / <CR 
The original output from this test case is in doc/testr.prt


./run/krc_made is the pre-made executable for PC linux

./run/krcone_master.inp
        Sample input file for running KRC in one-point mode.

./run/krcin_master.inp
        Sample input file for running full-up KRC

./idl/when2start.pro
        IDL routine to compute KRC start date

./idl/l_s.pro
        IDL routine for general conversion between Ls and dates
        [ Called by when2start ]


--------------- To make the executable --------------- 
cd Dist    # cd into the top of the Distribution system 
cd src
# may take some Guru to edit your local setup: sysdef.rules  & Makefile

make krc        
 # when successful
cd ../run
ln -s ../src/krc    # Then can run krc in the run directory
			# You may keep your input files here
			# Suggest that you send output files to ../out
			#   or somewhere outside the KRC Distribution system
# After deciding which test or your own input file to use:
krc          # this will start the execution.
