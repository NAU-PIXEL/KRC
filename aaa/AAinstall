       Guide to installing the KRC distribution  2009may12


In a directory one level above the place you wish to have KRC reside,
untar the krcdist.tar file.

  ./aaa/AAREADME will describe how the distribution package was made.

In ./src/ there is the Makefile that I use here, which will need 
editing for your site. You should remove reference to any libraries 
(unless you make some) and add to OBJECTS1 all the fortran source routines.

See your local Guru. Then do:  make krc
which should complile, although there may be some of warnings about 
different variable types for R2R

It will keep your file separated if in the run directory you make a line to the
executable: 
   ln -s ../src/krc .

run krc.  It will ask for an input file, you can make a soft link to 
/run/master.inp and then respond:  master.inp <CR>
  At the request  for a print file name, you can respond simply:  / <CR 
The original print log output from this test case is in doc/master.prt
The output binary file isrun/output/ master.t52 
The input file  run/master5x.inp tests all the type 5x output modes, 
the corresponding binary output files are run/output/master5.t5x  x=1,2,4,5,6 

Input file Mone.inp will run KRC in the one-point mode, using the specific 
points listed on one.prt

./run/krc_made is the pre-made executable for PC linux 64-bit machine
  I do not know if it will run on a 32-bit hardware

./run/Mone.inp
        Sample input file for running KRC in one-point mode.

./run/master.inp
        Sample input file for running full-up KRC, many latitudes

--------------- To make the executable --------------- 
cd Dist    # cd into the top of the Distribution system 
cd src
# may take some Guru to edit your local setup:   & Makefile

make krc        
 # when successful
cd ../run
ln -s ../src/krc    # Then can run krc in the run directory
			# You may keep your input files here
			# Suggest that you send output files to ../out
			#   or somewhere outside the KRC Distribution system
# After deciding which test or your own input file to use:
krc          # this will start the execution.
