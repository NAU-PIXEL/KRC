================================================================================

				METHOD

Program is designed to compute surface and subsurface temperatures for a global
set of latitudes at a full set of seasons, with enough depth to capture the
annual thermal wave, and to compute seasonal condensation mass. For historic
reasons, the code has substantial optimization. There are generalities that
allow this code set to be used for any solid body with any spin vector, in any
orbit (around any star); this is also the source of some of the complexity.
 
Method is explicit forward finite differences with exponentially increasing
layer thickness and binary time increase with depths where allowed by stability.
Depth parameter is scaled to the diurnal thermal skin depth.  Initially starts
at 18 hours with the mean temperature of a perfect conductor.  Second degree
perturbation is applied at the end (midnight) of the (third) day; this jumps the
mean temperature of all layers and the lower boundary to equal the mean surface
temperature.

Boundary condition treatment:
  Perturbation solution of quartic equation at surface for each iteration;
    temperature gradient assumed uniform in top interval.
  Lower boundary may be insulating or constant-temperature.

Atmospheric Radiation:
KRC uses a one-layer atmosphere that is grey in both the solar and infra-red
regions. parametric atmosphere. The default atmospheric parameters are based on
estimates of Mars' gas and aerosol properties.
  Delta-Eddington model for insolation; direct onto sloped surface and diffuse,
with possible twilight extension.
  Atmosphere temperature based on Delta-Eddington solar absorption and IR opacity
[Pre 2002jul16
  First-order treatment of scattering of solar radiation. 
  Diurnal temperature is modeled as sinusoidal with phase shift.]

Keplerian orbital motion; seasons are at uniform increments of time. Mean 
orbital elements are pre-calculated for any epoch (all planets and several
comets) by the PORB code set.

Units are SI;  days for orbital motion. (Revised from cal-cgs, 97july)

Options:
  Different Physical properties below a set layer (IC).
  Regional slope
  Three ways to handle seasonal global pressure variation

Atmosphere condensation: 
Global integral of CO2 frost-gas budget can control surface pressure.
Allows different surface elevation for each latitude zone.
  Zonal frost saturation temperature tracks local surface pressure.
Option for cap albedo to depend upon mean daily insolation.

			CONVERGENCE NOTES

Convergence prediction routine can't jump more than one time constant
(TAU=X**2/2) for the total thickness.  Therefore, if X(N1) is small,
make DDT smaller than usual.  If DELJUL is much smaller than 
(X(N1))**2/2, then DDT can be as large as 0.3.  Otherwise DDT must be about
0 for the prediction routine to work well (it assumes the 3rd derivative to
be 0).

           - - - - - - - - - -  INPUT FILE  - - - - - - - - - - 

All parameters for KRC are set by a formatted text file.  An example is
master.inp , which has default values for a 19 latitude set for a run of three
martian years, with the last output to disk. Parameter values are listed below
their titles, which are in many cases identical to the code name, and last
charater of the title is above the last location in the field. Thus, integer
values MUST be aligned. Titles with a leading "[" indicate that the value is not
used. The recommended procedure is to copy master.inp and edit only the values
you wish to change. The number of lines of Latitudes and Elevations must match
the value of N4, e.g., 2 lines for N4=11:20, entries beyond the N4 position may
be left blank or contain the end of the line. The 13 lines following Elevations
are a geometry matrix for Mars orientation and orbit in 2005, and should not be
touched; they can be replaced by running PORBMN carefully.

The title lines are skipped, so that you may put comments there carefully

The first input line is always KOLD,KEEP (I*), which sets file usage.
  These are described near the end of this help file under  DISK BINARY FILES.
  If and only if there is a third non-zero integer, then will read next card as
  6 debug flags, IDB1 to IBD6, which are normally zero. 
  See Section DEBUG OPTIONS below
The next (normally second) line is free text where you can outline the purpose 
of your run. 
 If KOLD=0, then a full set of input values is read. 

Change lines may follow immediately after the geometry matrix (see PARAMETER
CHANGES section below) . The end of definition of a "case" is indicated by a
"0/" line. Two successive "0/" lines ends the run.

Items with numbers inset 2 spaces below are computed, not input.                
The source code for 'krccom.inc' indicates which subroutine sets many of the 
parameters; as the routine name in lowercase just below the parameter name.

Can revert to constant albedo by hokey technique of using a bad name. E.g.,
  8 22 0 'badName' / turn variable albedo off
Files of text table of value versus season will be read at the start of a
run. These will apply to ALL latitudes. See example  valb1.tab
 
Variable Tau done the same way, with 22 being replaced with 23
CLIMTAU files have dust and ice opacity over season and latitude.

Because the binding routines to IDL are intolerant of any errors, the items in
the above commons have not been changed, Rather, in 2004July, and additional
common was added as a "catch-all" for any new items.

-------------------  Handy things -------------------------------

The first "hour" in printout and output arrays is 1/24 (strictly, 1/N24) of a
sol after midnight. E.g., the last time is midnight, not the first.

Atmospheric scale height, SCALEH, depends upon physical constants GRAV [input] 
and TATMAVE which (2007nov) is TATM [input] for the first season and 
thereafter the diurnal average of the prior season.

        ----- DISK BINARY FILES ----------

The routine TDISK is used to read or write direct-access binary files or bin5
files. The first season to write is specified by JDISK, all following seasons
will go to the same file. For direct-access files, each file record consists of
KRCCOM plus LATCOM or KRCCOM plus DAYCOM.

Disk output is largely controlled by the KRC  and TSEAS routines.

 0      Will output records of KRCCOM+LATCOM. Usual for large data-base.
 +n<=50 Will output records of KRCCOM+DAYCOM for the last computed latitude.

 >50 Will write custom bin5 file at the end of a run, with dimensionality from
3 to 5 (more possible). All 5x outputs allow multiple cases, each with a
"prefix" for each case consisting of 4 size integers (converted to Float)
followed by KRCCOM; after this may come vectors of parameters versus season. The
next-to-last dimension is increased to allow room for the prefix to be embedded
in the bin5 array.  KRC input items that would change any of the bin5 dimensions
are not allowed to change between cases. Each dimension is adjusted to the
necessary size. Each case has the same structure; this simplifies coding
although some items are then present redundantly. The number of cases allowed is
set by the size of case one, and printed as MASE at the end of the first case in
the print output. Cases beyond the maximum that can be stored will be executed,
but not saved.

The first 4 words of the prefix, and of thus of the bin5 array, are:
(1)=FLOAT(NWKRC)   ! Number of words in KRCCOM
(2)=FLOAT(IDX)     ! 1-based index of dimension with extra values
(3)=FLOAT(NDX)     ! Number of those extra
(4)=FLOAT(NSOUT)   ! [Available of other use]

    51=(N24 hours, 2: TSF TPF, N4 lats, NDX+ seasons, cases)
The prefix section contains: sub_array(seasons,5)(0-based index)
  0)=DJU5  1)=SUBS  2)=PZREF  3)=TAUD  4)=SUMF

    52=(N24 hours, 7 items, N4 lats, NDX+ seasons, cases)
The 7 items are:  1)=TSF  2)=TPF  3)=TAF  4)=DOWNVIS  5)=DOWNIR
6) packed with [NDJ4,DTM4,TTA4,      followed by TIN(2+
7) packed with [FROST4,AFRO4,HEATMM, followed by TAX(2+
  The number of layers for TIN and TAX is the smaller of: the number computed 
and that fit here.
The prefix is identical to Type 51

    54= (seasons, 5 items, NDX +nlat, cases)
        Items are (0-based index): 
        0= TSF=surface temperature at 1 am, 1= TSF at 13 hours,
        2= HEATMM=heat flow, 3= FROST4=frost amount, 
        4= TTB4 = predicted mean bottom temperature
        The prefix contains DJU5 

    55= (seasons,NDX+ items,cases).  For seasonal studies at one latitude
        ITEMS intended to be recoded as needed. Initial version is 9 items:
        [Tsur@ 1am,3am,1pm, spare, Tplan @1am,1pm, Surface heat flow,
        frost budget, T_bottom]
        The prefix contains DJU5        
         Can hold very large number of seasons and cases. 
        THIS MODE DOES NOT SUPPORT CONTINUATION RUNS

    56= [vectors&items, latitudes, NDX+ seasons, cases]
The first dimension is: TSF for all hours, TPF at all hours, 
 T4 for all layers at midnight, then FROST4,HEATMM,TTA4
The prefix is identical to Type 51

Once a disk file is opened, any records written will go into that file until a
new filename is specified (Type 8 Change line), which closes the current file.
It is best to ensure that output file does not already exist. If the file
already exists, new output may be written in same area, even if larger than
needed.

   
To run & save various cases for a single season, set N5 and JDISK to 1.

To extract a detailed day by saving DAYCOM to disk, set JDISK=N5, set a new
file name, and set K4OUT to desired latitude index (normally 1):

To run continuously with output every K ((1-3) days, set DELJUL=K*PERIOD
This will force prediction terms to near 0.
        setting N3=1 will turn off all prediction.
        set GGT large (to avoid iteration for convergence)
        set NRSET=999 (to avoid reset of layers)

To continue run with new parameters (e.g., DELJUL)
	3 21 1 'flag set to continue'
Note: changing DELJUL will cause reset of DJUL
Must increase the value of N5: e.g., 2 5 <bigger> 'Increase stopping season' 
Reset will not occur because J5 continues incrementing

------------------ To run two material types (2000jan23)

Set IC to the first layer to have the lower material properties ( >= 3)
Set COND2 to the lower material conductivity
Set DENS2 to the lower material density
Set SPHT2 to the lower material specific heat
If LOCAL is False, then initial setting of all layer thicknesses is based
upon the scale of the upper material; if it is set True, the thickness of the
lower layers is set by their scale.
  TDAY no longer allows unstable (thin) layers, and will increase the thickness
of the layer IC to satisfy the convergence safety factor FCONV if needed. 
However, the code to check on convergence was retained.

------------------ Setting temperature-dependant properties

Basic Flag is L10=LKOFT . If this is true, then the 8 input parmeters ConUp0 to
ConLo3 must be set to yield thermal conductivity as a function of temperature
for the upper and lower materials.  k=c0 +c1x + c2x^2 +c3x^3 where
x=(T-200.)*0.01 

Correspondingly, the 8 input parmeters SphUp0 to SphLo3 must be set for specific
heat
 
One way to generate the coefficients is to run for each of the upper and lower
materials the IDL procedure KOFTOP, which can call all of the
temperature-dependant routines. KOFTOP allows change of its parameters,
including grain radius and pressure, and will print the required parameters
ready for input to KRC.

Below are sample coefficients for thermal conductivity based on Sylvain
Piqueux's numerical model for un-cemented soils; the fit error is <0.1% over
120-320K. Left column is grain radius in micrometers, then the four normalized
coefficients ready for inclusion in a KRC input file, followed by the thermal
inertia at 220K for nominal density and specific heat.

              RUNNING THE "ONE-POINT" MODE (2002mar08)

A parameter initialization file   Mone.inp  is provided. It sets the KRC 
system into a reasonable mode for one-point calculations. Do not change that 
file unless you have read this entire file.

A line near the end of that file points to a file 'one.inp' which can contain
any number of one-point conditions. 'one.inp' is intended to be edited to
contain the cases you want; however, it must maintain the input format of the
sample file.

First Line is any title you wish. It must be present.
The second line is an alignment guide for the location lines. It must be there.

Each following line must start with an '11 '; this is a code that tells the
full-up KRC that is a one-point line. The next 9 fields are read with a fixed
format, and each item should be aligned with the last character of the Column
title. All items must be present, each line must extend at least to the m in
Azim; comments may extend beyond that, but they will not appear in the output
file. Be sure to have a <CR> at the end of the last input line.

The fields (after the 11) in the one-point input are:
	Ls 	L_sub_S season, in degrees
	Lat	Aerographic latitude in degrees
	Hour	Local time, in 1/24'ths of a Martian Day
	Elev	Surface elevation (relative to a mean surface Geoid), in Km
	Alb	Bolometric Albedo, dimensionless
	Inerti	Thermal Inertia, in SI units
	Opac	Atmospheric dust opacity in the Solar wavelength region
	Slop_	Regional slope, in degrees from horizontal
	Azim	Azimuth of the down-slope direction, Degrees East of North.

The two additional columns in the output file are:
  	TkSur	Surface kinetic temperature
	TbPla	Planetary bolometric brightness temperature


Try running the binary file first. If that fails, a Makefile is provided to
complile and link the program; simply enter "make krc" and pray. If this fails,
have your local guru look over the Makefile for local dependancies. Suggestions
of making the Makefile more universal are welcome.

To run the program, change to the directory where the program was built, and
enter "krc". You should get a prompt:
       ?* Input file name or / for default = Mone.inp 
If the initialization file still has this name and is in the same directory,
enter a single "/" and <CR>. Otherwise, enter the full pathname to the 
initialization file, with no quotes and no blanks.

A second prompt is for the name of the output file: 
       ?* Print file name or / for default = krc.prt
Again, if this is satisfactory, simply enter  / <CR> , else enter the desired
file path-name.

----- Comments on the One-point model. 

The initialization file of 2002mar08 is set to compute the temperatures at the
season requested without seasonal memory. It uses layers that extend to 5
diurnal skin depths. It does not treat the seasonal frost properly, so don't
believe the results near the edge of the polar cap. Execution time on a circa
2001 PC may be the order of 0.01 seconds per case.

The underlying model is the full version of KRC. By modifying the initialization
file, you can compute almost anything you might want. If you choose to try this,
best to read all of this document.

==============================================================================
Notes on how some aspects of the code work:

>> New file name: 
TCARD reads a card of Type 8, (and index is not 22 or 23)
 it calls  TDISK(4,0), which closes current file and sets  LOPN2=.FALSE.
   TCARD then moves new file name into common 
KRC checks if current (new) values of N5 and JDISK call for file output;
  with  LOPN2=.FALSE., KRC calls CALL TDISK (1,0) to open new file.

>> End of a case and end of a run:
TCARD sets KOUNT=0 at entry; this is incremented for every card except those of
type 0 ( or less) or type 11 (one-point mode). When type 0 is encountered, if
KOUNT is positive, does normal check of changes before return with IR=1 to
indicate start of a new case; if KOUNT is zero, returns with IR=5 and prints
'END OF DATA ON INPUT UNIT'

>> Setting one-point mode.
This can be done only in the first case, and there is no way to leave the 
one-point mode except to end the run.

TCARD encounters: " 10 * filename" as change card in the initial case.
  sets this as new input file name, then returns with IRET=4 
 [Thus, nothing following this change card in initial file is read]
KRC closes prior input file, opens the new one, and reads past first two lines 
    then calls TCARD to read first one-point line and sets LONE=true
    and drops into the top of the "case" loop. 
The master one-point should have a single latitude, no binary output file.
The small number of layers, days to converge, and seasons ignores the seasonal 
effect.

One-point request values are read by TCARD @ 310, which computes starting DJUL

TPRINT does linear interpolation of TOUT, which has N2 points be sol. To get Tp,
does interpolation of Tp-Ts at the hour points, and adds to interpolated Ts.
 

>> Starting conditions and date

Initial N5-JDISK sets the size of output files. There could be any number of
interior seasons where parameter changes are made; based on successive values of
IDOWN.

KRC initially calls TCARD(1
For each case loop, sets IQ=TCARD_return. If one-point mode, sets IQ=1

TSEAS uses IQ as key. It this is 1, then sets J5=0 and sets DJU5 to season -1.
else, increments J5 and increments DJU5 with current DELDUL. This allows use of
variable resolution dates. (so J5 never 0 when TCARD(2 called)
If J5 equals IDISK2, then TSEAS calls TCARD(2 to read changes, and proceeds to 
next season. 

TLATS uses J5 as the key; if it is <= 1, then starts from equilibrium
conditions, else uses predictions from prior season

The default is that change cards cause a fresh calculation of starting
conditions. Exceptions are when J5=IDOWN>0 at TCARD entry

>> Changing parameters within a seasonal run = Continue from memory.

When J5 reaches IDOWN, TSEAS calls TCARD, which will set IRET=3 before reading
the new parameters. May change DELJUL to get finer seasonal resolution, but must
NOT change N5

Use: Normal restrictions for what may not change for Type 5x files apply.
E.g., type 56 must NOT change number of latitudes nor total number of seasons.

Set N5 to be the total number of seasons desired, including those
after any number of parameter changes; it must NOT be changed later.

Set IDOWN to the season at the beginning of which wish to (first) change
parameters. The next set of changes could include a revised (larger) IDOWN.


>> Use of common PORBCM
Contents are described in porbcm.inc, 
PORBCM is filled by TCARD calling PORB0, which reads the first 60 items in 
5G15.7 from the input file and sets the value of PI. KRC references porbcm.inc 
but does not use it. 
TSEAS uses a few items to calculate LsubS; 
  CALL PORB (DJU5,DAU,PEA,PEB,HFA,HFB)  ! FIND CURRENT PLANET POSITION 
  TANOM = ATAN2 (PHOXX(2),PHOXX(1))     ! TRUE ANOMOLY
  SUBS = MOD(((TANOM+SLP)*RAD)+360.,360.)       ! L-SUB-S IN DEGREES
    SLP        L-SUB-S AT PERIAPSIS
    PHOXX(3)   VECTOR FROM FOCUS (SUN) TO PLANET: ORBITAL PLANE COORDINATES
TYEAR uses the value for length of year.


>> Lower boundary condition and resetting (jumping) layer temperatures.
At the start of a case, TLATS sets the temperature profile linear with depth
in one of three ways:
IB=0: top and bottom at equilbrium temperature
IB=1: top at equilbrium temperature, the bottom at TDEEP
IB=2: top and bottom at TDEEP

The kind of resetting is controlled by IB. In TCARD, if IB>0, then N1PIB=N1+1,
else N1PIB=N1.  T(N1+1) is not reset in the time calculations. In TDAY, for each
time step, the temperature of the lower boundary is set equal to T(N1PIB), which
results in either zero heat flow (IB=0) or a constant temperature.

>> Seasonal variation of albedo or opacity or ``climate''

When TCARD encounters a type of 8 and an index of 23(tau) [or 22(albedo)], it
transfers the text item into FVTAU (which is in COMMON /FILCOM/) and then calls
SEASTAU with an Ls of -999 .  SEASTAU when called with LSUB LT -90 calls
(providing IOD3) READTXT360, which reads file. Maximum number of rows is 360,
more will be ignored. First and last entry read are wrapped with +,- 360 to Ls
to ensure no interpolation faults later. TCARD sets the variable Tau flag, KVTAU,
true if table-read was successful, else it is set false.
If KVTAU is set, TSEAS calls SEASTAU at start of each season, resetting TAUD. 

If type 8 and index 23, the same as above except names are -ALB rather than -TAU

If type 8 and index 24, then TCARD calls CLIMTAU to open and read a .bin5 
climate file, and sets KVTAU=2

CLIMTAU expects to read a .bin5 file (season,latitude,2) with dust and ice
infrared opacities; this file is normally made by the IDL routine mopacity.pro .
Season is assumed to the uniform in Ls from 0 to 360-delta and latitude assumes
to be uniform from -90+delta/2 to +90-delta/2. CLIMTAU has firm-coded sizes, 72
seasons and 36 latitudes, and stores the file. Upon later calls from TLATS, it
returns the two opacities at a requested Ls and latitude, using bi-linear
interpolation.


>> Cap-dependent pressure
TSEAS:   BUF(1)=0.       ! flag for  TINT to compute areas
IF (N4.GT.8) CALL TINT (FROST4, BUF, SUMF)

Tlats
        IF (N4.GT.8) THEN       ! use global integrations

 KPREF.EQ.2

          PCO2G = PCO2M -PCAP ! all changes are pure CO2
