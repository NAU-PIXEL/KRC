Bob:

Phrases which ask you for something are in upper-case.

You said "We run for 20 sols and output the last sol."  DOES YOU SUN-MARS
GEOMETRY CHANGE EVERY TIME STEP, OR EVERY DAY, OR DOES MARS SIT AT LS=100 FOR
TWENTY DAYS?

I would expect the atmosphere temperature comparison to be reasonably
valid. Because I use an atmosphere that is vertically isothermal it should be
comparable to a mass-weighted result.

The KRC To-of-atmosphere bolometric temperature is defined by:
    sigma Tp^4 = sigma Tp^4 (e^-tau) + sigma Tp^4 (1.-e^-tau)
where tau is the infrared atmospheric opacity (tau sub R in my LaTeX writeups)
given by: 
     TAUIR=(CABR+TAUD*TAURAT)*(PRES/PTOTAL)
where    CABR  = IR opacity of dust-free atmosphere.  Set at 0.18
	TAUD   = Mean visible opacity of dust, solar wavelengths
	TAURAT = Ratio of thermal to visible opacity of dust
        PRES   = Local surface pressure at current season
	PTOTAL = Global annual mean surface pressure at 0 elev., 689.7 Pascal

This should yield a result similiar to your effective radiance temperature
calculation. I found that lowering CABR to 0.15 lowers both surface and
atmospheric temperatures about 1K, while increasing the bolometric variation
about 1K. DO YOU HAVE A VALUE FOR THE EFFECTIVE OPACITY OF A DUST-FREE 
NOMINAL ATMOSPHERE?

For the VL-1 @ Ls=100 case, the KRC local surface pressure is ~900 Pascal and
the infrared opacity (tau) will be about 0.626. This pressure is considerably
higher than you use. AM I USING TOO HIGH AN ANNUAL MEAN PRESSURE AT 0 ELEVATION?
I tried change the reference pressure to 540 Pa; about the only effect was to
increase the atm. diurnal variation about 3 K.

To try to more closely approach what the GCM does, I have run some additional
KRC cases. I expect it is easier for me to run more cases than for you.

First, I ran a 3-year case [case 3 in plot] with Visible/IR (taurat) dust ratio
= 1.0, all other conditions the same as in my July 24 runs [case 1 in plot,
taurat=0.5]. This raises the atm. temperature about 4K and decreases the
bolmetric temperature variation about 8K. (see attached jpeg figure).

I then modified this by starting all layers at 180K and holding the bottom layer
(number 19, at 1.1 meters) at that temperature; this surprisingly lowers all
temperatures all day about 1K [case 4 in plot].

I have run a KRC case with 1-sol spaceing between "seasons", starting 20 days
before Ls=100 with taurat=1.0, again starting all layers at 180K and holding the
bottom layer there [dotted line in figure]. This may be as close as KRC can come
to running the same conditions as your reference GCM run. 

Even with 29 layers, near the maximum for KRC as currently coded,
this themal inertia only gets to a total depth of 8 meters, so I am wondering
WHAT IS YOUR SUBSURFACE LAYER STRUCTURE LIKE?

The temperatures from KRC relative to the GCM are listed below.  The GMS means
were faked UNTIL I GET DIGITAL TABLES FROM YOU.

               Surface Kin.       TOA Bolometric        Atmosphere 
Case         min   max  mean     min   max  mean     min   max  mean
GCM        182.1 262.7 215.5   186.5 249.5 213.1   196.2 206.5 201.4
TR=0.5       8.4   5.9   7.0     3.5  -0.3   0.9    -8.5 -11.4  -9.9
TR=1.       14.9   9.7  12.4     8.4  -3.9   2.5    -5.5  -6.2  -5.9
Tdeep=180   13.5   8.8  11.2     7.2  -4.8   1.5    -6.4  -7.2  -6.8
20 sol      11.4   7.7   9.6     5.5  -6.0   0.0    -7.6  -8.5  -8.0

In summary, 
1) KRC surface is about 10K warmer and amplitude 5K smaller than the GCM
2) KRC atmosphere is consistently ~7K colder than the GCM average, 
3) KRC atmosphere variation is about the same as the GCM
4) The 20-sol startup may still leave temperatures a couple degrees low

Based upon this, I would be interested in a comparison of the models for a
condition with minimum atmosphere (away from the poles) to see if the surface
temperature differences have an identifieable pattern.  CAN YOU EXTRACT THE
RESULTS FROM AN EXISTING ANNUAL RUN AT A MAXIMUM-ALTITUDE TEMPERATE LOCATION?

71,
3,31,33,


need to extract a latitude and season for all cases, in same form as GCM
perhaps put all in one array, identify one as the reference model.
 Have good names assigned to each!


 print the changes for ref model for all the others.
