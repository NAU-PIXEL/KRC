       Guide to installing the KRC distribution  2013jan25

----------- Installation Guide ----------- 
Create a directory where you wish the KRC system to reside.
cd to this directory, which I will here call K
untar the krcdist.tar file. This should create and populate several subdirectories
cd to K/aaa
First installation only: Hopefully can skip for updates
   edit two lines for paths in step61 and in step6
   run step61	# This will copy files to be edited locally to safe area 
      Check/edit the files that were copied
Run step6	# This will copy edited file back into the build area
> cd K/src/cfiles    # cd to area of C code 
> make -f Makec      # Build the C library
cd to K/src          # cd to the Dir with all the FORTRAN source code
> make krc           # Make the executable. Report any fixes you make
> make porbmn        # make the PORB system. " "
> cd ../run	     # cd to area with sample input files
> ln -s ../src/krc .     # create soft link to the executable
> ln -s ../src/porbmn .  # " "

In ./src/cfiles there is the Makec makefile which may need editing for your site.
It builds a library of low-level I/O routines written in C
It is required before a Fortran build

krc and mkrc (not included in most distributions) require different versions
 of the common krccom. For krc, need krccom2.inp, copied to krccom.inp


In ./src/ there is the Makefile  which will probably need 
editing for your site. You should remove reference to any libraries 
(unless you make some) except the cfiles one.

I have had problems with FORTRAN unformatted files in IDL, probably related to
different interpretations of what is the lenghts of the extra word FORTRAN adds
at each end of a file. At ASU, the problem was resolved by using the
 -fdefault-integer-8  flag.

See your local Guru. Then do:  make krc
which should complile, although there may be some of warnings about 
different variable types for R2R

Copy master.inp to krc.inp  and edit to fit your needs; the default
name that krc looks for is krc.inp. If you want 5 degree latitude spacing,
'mast37' contains just the latitudes and mean elevations for every 5 degrees.

Run krc.  It will ask for an input file name. If you wish krc.inp,
    respond simply:  / <CR 
  At the request for a print file name, you can respond simply:  / <CR 


The original print log output for master.inp is run/output/master.prtOrig
    The output binary file is run/output/masterA.t52 
The input file  run/master5x.inp tests all the type 5x output modes, 
the corresponding binary output files are run/output/master5B.t5x  x=1,2,4,5,6 

Input file krcOneA.inp will run KRC in the one-point mode, using the specific 
points listed on oneA.inp. The expected output is in oneA.prtOrig

krc          # this will start the execution. 
Respond to first request with:  krc.inp   or   simply  /
Respond to second request with:  / 
Should run, creating  krc.prt and a binary file defined by the 8 0 0 ---
 line in the input file

--------------  Use of the IDL programs ---------------------

Before starting IDL, edit and source idlPath.

Look at init.pro (probably requires an IDL guru), edit it as appropriate for
your installation, and run it as the first thing after starting IDL.  It uses
setcolor.pro to setup 256 colors.
