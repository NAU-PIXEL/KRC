        GUIDE TO BUILDING THE KRC DISTRIBUTION TAR FILE

------------ Begin  ONLY FOR THE FIRST DISTRIBUTION  Begin------------

Decide on the top directory of the distribution files.   ~/krc/Dist/
Decide on the directory structure below this. Described in  step2

Create these directories

Create the distribution system scripts
Put all these in Dist/aaa/  Edit in semi-permanent fashion
Any other files that must be edited: copy them into Dist/aaa and edit there


 - step2 Script file to build accumulate all the source code and files needed to
 make and run the executable application. [[ Will also build the LaTeX
 documents to Postscript and pdf.] Do by hand]

 - sysdef.rules    System-dependant rules for Make. 
   May need to edit for your local system environment

 - Makefile  The make file to build the shared object library system

 - step3  Script to make the tar file

---------------  End  ONLY FOR THE FIRST DISTRIBUTION  End ----------------

For a new release:
If any new routines or new input files:
  Add these to the soft links in step2
  Update the Make file


Execute the /home/hkieffer/krc/Dist/step2 script, which empties the build
area, creates directories and copies files into the build area

  DO NOT REMOVE FILES FROM   ~/krc/Dist/aaa/ 

  RENAME the prior distribution tar file to archive it

Execute the /home/hkieffer/krc/Dist/step3 script, which will move to one
directory above the construction directory and Tar the entire code set,
following the symbolic links

Send  AAinstall krcdist.tar  to the customer

	TESTING 

Test the build:
 cd ~/krc/impl
untar the Dist file
Follow the directions of AAinstall

once all works well, run step 3b to include the executable krc

Final:  Delete the intermediate LaTeX files
	Delete all the *.o files
