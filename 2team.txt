TES and THEMIS Folks

I have developed a new atmosphere section for the KRC thermal model
which has decent physics for a one-layer gray atmosphere. Many of the
prior "tuning" parameters to match the Haberle model at the Viking sites
are gone. It supports both the "one-point" mode and full-up models to 
keep you endlessly amused.

Tim is putting the binary executable and several helpful text files
on out website. There are two IDL routines which help to calculate
when to start a model if you want to begin storing seasonal records
after running for a while to approach equilibrium.
