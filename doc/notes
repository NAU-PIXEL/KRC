2003jan23 Notes following tutorial for Robin Fergeson, Josh Bandfield
and Tim Titus.

One-point model temperatreus are influenced by elevation if the opacity
is >0 Note, negative opacities can cause very long (infinite?) run
times.

If N5=0, then the values entered for DAU ans SEDC are used for a single
season.

If KPREF=2 and N4>8, then will do global condensed frost integration, in
which case you better have input a reasonable set of montonically
increasing latitudes.

The stored times-of-day are such that the last one is "midnight". E.g.,
Hour 1 is 1/24 of a sol after midnight. (in tday.f, see use of JJH)

Frost amount units are kg/m^2

Minor code changes to insure non-negative TAUD and DRSET, and to avoid opening
output binary file if it would not be written to.
